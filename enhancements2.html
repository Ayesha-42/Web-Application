 <h2> The core enhancements for this particular assignment:-</h2><br />
		<ul id="mainen">
			<li><a href="quiz.html#">Dynamic display </a> of the questions using animation in a slideshow format. These animations use the jQuery library which follows the general syntax of '$(selector).animate({params},speed,callback);'. Used the nested functions algorithm for sequencial display of those animations giving it overall consistency and visual appeal. Under the animate tool variations in the CSS numeric properties has also been used for distinguishable and aesthetic effects for example and the fonts of the timer. Even the navigation bars(on the left) of the webpage links extend to a larger width when the mouse is hovered over it and then collapses to the same when mouse is removed from over it. </li>
			<li><a href="quiz.html">Timer</a> was used to time the user's performance on the quiz for 5 minutes. If the user was still attempting the quiz for beyond that time the quiz will automatically submit with the values entered thus far and is redirected to the results page with the same information. After testing out many methods around the <span>setInterval and clearInterval</span> Events this function was arrived at. It starts automatically when the page is loaded. The trigger event is automatic when the quiz.html page loads with a valid attempt for the user to give the quiz. When time is up one attempt is decresed from the 3, if none are left the quiz collapses for that particular student ID. The user may also click on the 'Keep Timer' button along the time display to pin the timer countdown to the right-top corner of the window whilst attempting the questions below as well. It is in a transparent yet highlighted background for good visibility as well as flexible visibility of the questions.</li>
