 </ul>
 <h3> The core enhancements for this particular assignment:-</h3><br />
 <ul id="mainen">
 <li><a href="index.html#footer">Footnotes </a>styling in the traditional form seen in many websites. Inwebsite linking to further information availble on that particular topic accompanied with hightlighing and navigation tool to return back to the place one was reading from in the main website. It also makes use of many of the CSS selector types and intense stlying as per one's choice. One has to click on the superscripted number in sqaure braces to direct them to the corresponding footnote, then click on the back option to return to original destination. This feature has been included in the main informative pages of the website- the index and the topic webpage. It adds more quality and legitimacy to the content as well as the formatting layout. It is also interactive and engaging with the client by supplying more information if needed by them. This <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/ ">  website</a> gave me an idea how to implement my agenda.</li>
  <li><a href="index.html#sidebar">Navigation icons</a> along with the hyperlink to navigate through the webpages on Assignment 1's website. It provides more visual appeal and easy to indentify quality to the side panel. Although icons are primarily embedded using external javascript but there ways to do it purely through CSS and HTML as well. I used the font awesome website's css link to accommodate the styling of the hexadecimal/unicode values of the icons into the webpage as seen in the navigation bar on the left of each. However this may have the tendency to result in the breach that the 'document uses the Unicode Private Use Area(s), which should not be used in publicly exchanged documents. (Charmod C073)'. I have have used the class reference. Other methods include linking with the bootstrap and google css documents which are available online and then using an inline tag like i or span to implement the styling using the respective class where its described. A refernece link to understand this process better is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_icon_buttons.asp">here</a>.<span id="gen">icons imported from website- <a href="https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/">Font Awesome </a>under the icons catergory.</span> It is compatible with Internet Explorer versions 11 and 10,chrome, firefox, safari and opera, the major last two versions. It is also supports mobile platforms of iOS latest and Andriod 6,5 and 4. </li>
